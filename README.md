## LLM tools

> **Warning:** AI should not replace your own intelligence. It is just text completion. It may be useful e.g. for debugging code, but *you* must be the one designing the code, otherwise it will create stupid routines that lead nowhere, etc.
> It is not *creative* by itself, that's on you.
> On top of that, running local models is a must if you don't want to fuel the machine while giving away your private data for free.
> Mind that stochastic parrots raise important social and environmental challenges, and you should use them with care ([doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922](https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922), [doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4678265](https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4678265)).
> Be careful not to develop a dependency from these tools.

**Local**
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/). Run local LLM models
- [Meetily](https://meetily.zackriya.com/). Meeting assistant

**Online** (*a.k.a.* giving away for free your personal data and your soul)
- [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/). Open source LLMs
- [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). VSCode plugin that helps you write code, free with the university account. It also adds a chat window to get coding insights
- [Elicit](https://elicit.org/). Ask a Question, get summarized results from papers
- [Deepl Write](https://www.deepl.com/en/write). Check your grammar or translate, really useful even for scientific texts
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
