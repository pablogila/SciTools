## LLM tools

> **Warning:** AI should not replace your own intelligence. It is just text completion. It may be useful for debugging code, for example, but *you* must be the one designing the code, otherwise it will create stupid routines that lead nowhere, etc. Stochastic parrots raise important social and environmental challenges, and you should use them with care (https://doi.org/10.1145/3442188.3445922, https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4678265).

- [Github Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot). VSCode plugin that helps you write code, free with the university account. It also adds a chat window to get coding insights.
- [Elicit](https://elicit.org/). Ask a Question, get summarized results from papers.
- [Deepl Write](https://www.deepl.com/en/write). Check your grammar or translate, really useful even for scientific texts.
- [HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/). Open source LLMs
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com/)
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/)
- [DeepSeek](https://chat.deepseek.com/)

## Other GitHub repositories

- [SciTools](https://pablogila.github.io/SciTools/). Links, tutorials and resources for all your scientific endeavours (this page).
- [Aton](https://pablogila.github.io/ATON). Python package with powerful and comprehensive tools for cutting-edge materials research, focused on (but not limited to) neutron science. It provides a range of spectral analysis tools and physico-chemical constants. It also also allows you to easily create, edit and analyse all kinds of text files, with a special focus on *ab-initio* calculations.
- [PlantillaLatex](https://github.com/pablogila/PlantillaLatex). LaTeX template, with info and description of useful commands.
